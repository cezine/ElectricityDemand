# New York City Energy Demand

**Author**: Sejin Jang


## Overview 

According to the UN climate report this year, some of the global warming effects are now irreversible. The effects of this are detrimental, as the sea levels continue to rise, due to the melting of ice in the arctic, areas located below the sea level are at high risk. Furthermore, as the temperature increases, this also results in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and drought. To mitigate global warming, some have already resorted to using clean and renewable energy sources. This can be seen as more communities are trying to replace their traditional energy sources that rely on fossil fuels, with clean energy such as solar and wind. Hence, it is crucial to estimate the future energy demand so that a more clear and realistic goal can be set for the communities.

In this project, I will build a predictive model that estimates the future electricity consumption in New York City based on its weather data. Energy usage is correlated with the temperatures. People are more likely to use more air conditioning in hot weather and more heaters during cold periods. The project aims to help decision makers from all sectors understand the magnitude of the global warming effect and to aid in better preparation as we attempt to meet the future energy demand while adopting more clean and renewable energy.


### Data

NYC Electricity Consumption Dataset: The dataset was found at the NYC Open Data website. The data was provided by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)It contains monthly consumption and cost data from 2010 January to 2021 Feburary by borough and development. It includes features such as utility vendor and meter information.

NYC Weather Dataset: The dataset was gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an American scientific and regulatory agency within the United States Department of Commerce. It includes various weather data such as temperature, wind and precipitation. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GSOM/locations/CITY:US360019/detail
